                        <p>At FriendlyKittens our Kittens sell for $1050. Lynx and Lilac are more rare colors and are 
                            priced higher. Females have a price premium of $50. We also offer multiple kitten purchase 
                            discounts as well as cash referral bonuses.

                            Most kittens are adopted between 8 to 10 weeks old and always go home with 
                            their first set of shots . We provide an adoption packet containing a clean 
                            signed bill of health (free of genetic defects, fleas, parasites, ringworm, 
                            etc.) from our local vet office
                        </p>
